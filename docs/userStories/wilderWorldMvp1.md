# Wilder World MVP #1

The scope of these stories will be fulfilling the web3 middleware needs of the [Wilder World](https://www.wilderworld.com/) minimally viable product (MVP) (see [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/5bOkQKkrQ2jCZR6N3oUCMj/ZNS-Front-End?node-id=3262%3A0)). They are ordered by priority.

## Developer

1. As a developer, I need good documentation because I want to easily consume this SDK without having to speculate about or reverse engineer its behavior.
2. As a developer, I want easy configuration that works out of the box because I want to have the option to reconfigure the SDK as I need to without being forced to do so. 
3. As a developer, I want to easily **connect, disconnect**, and know when a user's web3 **wallet** is not connected because I do not want to learn how to use web3 libraries to do this myself.
4. As a developer, I need **data** I obtain to **not be stale** before I perform an operation on it so that the end user's web3 transactions do not fail.
5. As a developer, I want to easily obtain read only **mock data** from my function calls, rather than real data, because I need to demo how my dApp will eventually look like with real data.
6. As a developer, I want to [**watch**](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/core/ApolloClient/#ApolloClient.watchQuery) [**(sub)domain transfer**](https://github.com/zer0-os/zNS-subgraph/blob/f8969a60f2ad10f811fb36ff56a14f8b5b3af5ec/src/mapping.ts#L4) and [**metadata locked**](https://github.com/zer0-os/zNS-subgraph/blob/f8969a60f2ad10f811fb36ff56a14f8b5b3af5ec/src/mapping.ts#L5) **events** because I need to know precisely when those occur to know when to reload data for the end user.
7.  As a developer, I want to [**poll**](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/core/ApolloClient/#ApolloClient.query) for [**(sub)domain royalties amount changed**](https://github.com/zer0-os/zNS-subgraph/blob/f8969a60f2ad10f811fb36ff56a14f8b5b3af5ec/src/mapping.ts#L8), [**metadata unlocked**](https://github.com/zer0-os/zNS-subgraph/blob/f8969a60f2ad10f811fb36ff56a14f8b5b3af5ec/src/mapping.ts#L6), and [**(sub)domain metadata changed**](https://github.com/zer0-os/zNS-subgraph/blob/f8969a60f2ad10f811fb36ff56a14f8b5b3af5ec/src/mapping.ts#L7) because I need to know eventually when these occur to know when to reload data for the end user.
8.  As a developer, I want to be able to [obtain](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/core/ApolloClient/#ApolloClient.query) **(sub)domain data on demand** because I need to display this to the end user.
9.  As a developer, I want to be able to [obtain](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/core/ApolloClient/#ApolloClient.query) **account (profile) data on demand** because I need to display this to the end user.
10. As a developer, I want to be able to [**register a (sub)domain**](https://github.com/zer0-os/zNS/blob/340c03160e71539128111b7210fb7d6048793463/docs/integration/v1.1/BasicController.json#L126), with locked metadata by default and avoid attempting to register duplicate (subdomains), because I need to support the user creating (sub)domains, avoiding failed transactions, without needed the metadata to be modified or locked afterwards before transferring.
11. As a developer, I need to be able to edit and create profiles to support the end user in their desire to feel part of an exciting community.
12. As a developer, I want to know about the end user's pending transactions because I want to display them on the relevant component to let the end user know about them.
13. As a developer, I want to be able to be able to take some action when an end user transaction completes depending on what object the transaction relates to because that will allow me to know what components I will need to re-render or what data is potentially stale.
14. As a developer, I want to easily write **mock data** to the browser's local storage, rather than real data, because I need to write tests that will work for both a demo and production version of my dApp.

## End User

1. As an end user, I need to be able to easily [**connect and disconnect**](https://www.figma.com/file/5bOkQKkrQ2jCZR6N3oUCMj/ZNS-Front-End?node-id=3262%3A22) my choice **web3 wallet** because I not technical nor interested in debugging my wallet connection.
2. As an end user, I need to be **notified** by the dApp **before my web3 transactions fail** in my wallet because transaction failures in my wallet will worry me.
3. As an end user, I want to obtain certain [**high level information on each (sub)domain**](https://www.figma.com/file/5bOkQKkrQ2jCZR6N3oUCMj/ZNS-Front-End?node-id=3262%3A22): its number, its name, its abbreviation, its last bid, its number of bids, its last sale price, its trade price because I want to evaluate whether it is a worthwhile investment and a desirable purchase for me.
4. As an end user, I want to obtain [**certain summary information on each (sub)domain**](https://www.figma.com/file/5bOkQKkrQ2jCZR6N3oUCMj/ZNS-Front-End?node-id=3262%3A368): its name, its (sub)domain name, its last offer (WILD & USD), its owner, its creator, its image, and its subdomains (see #3) because I want to evaluate whether it is a worthwhile investment and a desirable purchase for me.
5. As an end user, I want to obtain [**certain low level information on each (sub)domain**](https://www.figma.com/file/5bOkQKkrQ2jCZR6N3oUCMj/ZNS-Front-End?node-id=3262%3A398): its name, its number, its owner, its creator, its (sub)domain, its price (WILD & USD), its story, its views, its edition out of its total editions, its contract address, and its transaction history (offers made, transfers made, offers accepted, when it was created).
6. As an end user, I need to be able to [**create a (sub)domain** (mint an NFT)](https://www.figma.com/file/5bOkQKkrQ2jCZR6N3oUCMj/ZNS-Front-End?node-id=3262%3A896), providing its name, story, image, and creator/owner (myself) because I want to create valuable artworks for others.
7. As an end user, I need to be able to [**transfer a (sub)domain**](https://www.figma.com/file/5bOkQKkrQ2jCZR6N3oUCMj/ZNS-Front-End?node-id=3262%3A741), providing an address, because I want the flexibility to either use different wallets or give the (sub)domain to someone else.
8.  As an end user, I want to be able to [**create, edit, and view the profiles**](https://www.figma.com/file/5bOkQKkrQ2jCZR6N3oUCMj/ZNS-Front-End?node-id=3262%3A314) of (sub)domain creators & owners because I want to feel part of an exciting community.
9.  As an end user, I want to be able to be notified when my transactions are being processed and when they are complete within the dApp because I don't want to continually check my wallet for that.
