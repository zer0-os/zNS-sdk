## Developer

- As a developer, I want to easily connect, disconnect, and know when a user's web3 wallet is not connected because I do not want to learn how to use web3 libraries to do this myself.
- As a developer, I want to easily obtain mock data from my function calls, rather than real data, because I need to demo how my dApp will eventually look like with real data.
- As a developer, I need data I obtain to never be stale so that the end user's web3 transactions do not fail.
- As a developer, I need to obtain the following up-to-date data: domains, 

## End User

- As an end user, I need to be able to easily [connect and disconnect](https://www.figma.com/file/5bOkQKkrQ2jCZR6N3oUCMj/ZNS-Front-End?node-id=3151%3A908) my choice wallet because I not technical nor interested in debugging my wallet connection.
- As an end user, I want to obtain certain [high level information on each domain/subdomain](https://www.figma.com/file/5bOkQKkrQ2jCZR6N3oUCMj/ZNS-Front-End?node-id=3151%3A861): its edition number, its name, its abbreviation, its last bid in USD, the number of bids that have been made on it, its last sale price, its trade price because I want to evaluate whether it is a worthwhile investment and a desirable purchase for me.

- As an end user, I want to obtain [certain low level information on each domain/subdomain](https://www.figma.com/file/5bOkQKkrQ2jCZR6N3oUCMj/ZNS-Front-End?node-id=3151%3A1149): its name, its number, its owner, its creator, its domain, its price (WILD & USD), its story, its views, its edition out of its total editions, its contract address, and its transaction history (offers made, transfers made, offers accepted, when it was created).
- As an end user, I need to be able to easily buy a domain/subdomain because if I consider it a worthwhile investment and a desirable purchase, I will want to own it.
- As an end user, I want to be able to create, edit, and view the profiles of domain creators & owners because I want to feel part of an exiciting community.
- As an end user, I need to be able to [create a domain/subdomain (mint an NFT)](https://www.figma.com/file/5bOkQKkrQ2jCZR6N3oUCMj/ZNS-Front-End?node-id=3151%3A1731) because I want to create valuable artworks for others.

- As an end user, I need my web3 transactions never to fail because I do not want to waste my ETH on gas fees for failed transactions.
