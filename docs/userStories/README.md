# zNS-sdk User Stories

These user stories define the desired user experience for the zNS SDK. We have identified two user types for this product:

- Developer: a front end developer building the Wilder World app using the zNS SDK. We assume they have knowledge of front end technologies and frameworks but limited or no knowledge of web3 technologies such as subgraphs, smart contracts, wallets, etc.
- End User: a user of Wilder World that uses the zNS SDK. We assume that they have basic knowledge of wallets but are, otherwise, completely non-technical.

This means that we have two broad categories of user stories: those for Developers and those for End Users.
Here is our user story template:
As {who} {when} {where}, I {want} because {why}

Current user story categories:
- [Wild World MVP #1](wilderWorldMvp1.md)
- [Wild World MVP #2](wilderWorldMvp2.md)
- [Wild World MVP #3](wilderWorldMvp3.md)
